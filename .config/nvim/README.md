# Neovim
Terminal-base text editor that's blazingly fast, composable, customizable and most importantly when you master `vim` motions you won't need to exist it son!

## Structure:
- `init.lua` contains all the necessary plugins (in my preference) to kick-off your `nvim` journey.
- `lua` directory encompasses all the custom scripts for code linting, completing, formating, diagnosis all configured by the means of [`lsp`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).
